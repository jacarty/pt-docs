### Section 1: Introduction - Why Penetration Testing Matters

**Content:**
- The £4.88 Million Question
- What if I told you that a single security breach costs UK businesses an average of £4.53 million?
- And that 74% of large UK businesses experienced a breach last year?
- In the next 5 minutes, you'll master how to turn these statistics into compelling conversations that close deals.
- **Your Goal:** Transform security from a "nice-to-have" into a "must-have-now" business imperative.

   - A) Suggest they make time
   - B) Offer to do everything without IT involvement
   - C) Show minimal time commitment: 30-min scoping, 1-hour kickoff, independent testing, 2-hour results - under 4 hours total ✓
